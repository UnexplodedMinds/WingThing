WingThing started as a Raspberry Pi project and morphed into an Arduino project since it is just easier to get the sensors to work correctly on an Arduino since that's what they're targeted for, and the libraries are easily obtainable.

The initial application is to work with the Stratofier Android app but with some modification of the sending protocol it could work with lots of other things.  All of the parts are easily available from Amazon or directly from Adafruit.

Stratofier will send the barometric pressure setting from your Android device so the altimiter sensor will give you an altitude corrected for the local barometric pressure.
